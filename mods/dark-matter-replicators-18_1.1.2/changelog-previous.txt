0.7.13_R
Fixed mod for 0.17.69


--Original mod's changelog below--

0.4.0
	Version was both the first 0.12 compatible version and the first public release.
0.4.1
	DyTech ores are plates are now working again. You can still use this mod without DyTech.
0.4.2
	Now Youki resources can be replicated as well. You do not need Youki to use this mod either, it is also an optional dependency.
0.4.3
	Some recipes tweaked
	Advanced belt replication added
	There should be fewer technical problems when used with other mods
	Also, I have now realized the need for changelogs which are made as the changes are made and will start writing down my changes for later versions of this mod.
0.4.4
	Created text files for changelog and roadmap
	Made basic and advanced electric poles into unconnected technologies
	Reduced the number of times that Factorio's data table is extended when making a new recipe (though this probably doesn't matter)
	Caused tenemut to be found in smaller deposits and to only be linked to stone
	Made it possible for a replication technology to have more than one item assigned to it
	Merged the rail replication technologies
	Merged the replication technologies for both the advanced electric poles
	Modified the item existence checker so that it can recognize items of the repair-tool, mining-tool and deconstruction-item item types
	Got repair pack replication working as a result
	Merged the replication techs for Yuoki pure elements into their equivalent plates
	Cleaned up the category icon for replication recipes
0.5.0
	Made the recipes for crafting the replicators themselves appear in the right order
	Added bob ores and plates to replication
	Made different borders for the different types of replication (but it looks hideous and I will need to do it again)
	Removed the 600 that appears in the lower right corner of the lava technology icon
	Added replication of mopower uranium
	Modified Science Pack 1 replication to use stone gears if DyTech is active
	Added replication of Treefarm pharmaceuticals and replaced the late-game wood replication with a Treefarm germling

	Remade the gem replication system yet again
	Set the cost of transport belts to change depending on whether or not DyTech is enabled

	Rebalanced uranium costs
	Changed the tungsten ore photo to the right one
	Added titanium (how did I miss that?)
	Rebalanced the costs of sulfur, plastic, explosives and everything which uses them as ingredients

	Moved bob logic boards down a tier
	Moved bob basic circuit boards up a tier

	Updated some recipes to match changes in version 13
	Changed landfills from a mod replication to a vanilla replication

0.6.3 - Factorio 14 Hotfix
	Made mod compatible with Factorio version 0.14
	Made it impossible to use via element replication to skip ever having to make tungsten in Bob's Mods
0.7.0 - Factorio 15 Support
	Removed every non-replication part of the mod (phasing ammo, expansion port and small furnace)
	Made it possible to configure more parts of the replicators by editing replicators.lua
	Moved technology flavor text to relevant items as it does not seem like that bug is going to be fixed anytime soon
	Added mod config options so that replicators.lua does not need to be (and now should not be) edited
	Fixed the replication recipe category icon
	Modified the replication recipe creation function so that it uses layered icons to create its own replication icons rather than loading them from their own files

0.7.1 - Very Fast Hotfix
	Fixed a typo in the Space Science Pack's cost which made it way too cheap replicate
	Added localization strings to nuclear items
0.7.2 - Ease of Editing Update
	Fixed the replication cost of oil and by extension oil products
	Localization strings for replication technologies are now automatically generated
0.7.3 - The Return of Mod Stuff
	Fixed a bug where scaled replicators appeared too far to the side from their actual positions
	Greatly increased the science pack costs and required types of science pack for researching tenemut-based technologies so that the player can't gain access to higher tier replications too early
	Created a system where a table of replications is built up from this mod and potentially other mods which can use this one and then at the very end that table is used along with various recipes to generate the replications (basically you don't get to replicate science pack 3s before you have an assembly line for producing them)
	Rebalanced replication costs to take into account long production times (like most chemistry) and the use of energy intensive machinery (like oil refinineries)
	Rebalanced the default replicator energy consumption so placing down a single tier 1 replicator no longer causes a sudden cliff in energy consumption and also so that all tiers of replicator will have nice round numbers for their energy consumption amounts
	Remade all replications to use the table system and usually to reference recipes in order to calculate costs
	Added replication of things from Factorissimo2, Yuoki Industries, Bio Industries and much of Bob's Mods
	Made recipe-based calculations work correctly with the changed recipes in Bob's Mods
0.7.4 - Mod Support Bugfixes

	Updated the mod to account for the changes made to the internal names of various things in conpatible mods
0.7.5 - Icon Bugfix
	Fixed a bug where a crash occurs during prototyping if there is a replication for an item with a layered icon
	Added direct support for the items and changes in AAI Industry
0.7.6 - Factorio 0.16 Compatibility
	Fixed a bug where air replication cannot be researched if Angel's mods are enabled
	Updated the mod to work with Factorio 0.16
	Created new ore graphics for tenemut
0.7.7 - Compatibility Stuff
	Fixed Factorissimo compatibility
	Localized name overrides can now do anything regular localized names can do
	Added replication of vanilla artillery shells and cliff explosives
	Disabled uranium magazine replication while Bob Warfare is enabled (for now)
	Created a new icon for the replication recipes category
0.7.8 - Additional Bob's Mods Compatibility and Connectivity
	Prevented the technologies generated by this mod from having redundant prerequisites
	Fixed a bug where if a disabled replication has itself as a prerequisite and is a prerequisite for another replication then the mod enters an infinite loop at startup 
	Added new replications for various Bob's mod machines, ammunition and other components
0.7.9 - Other Mod Crash Fixes
	Fixed a bug where Factorio would crash during prototyping if this mod and Bob Logistics were enabled but Bob Warfare was not
	Fixed a bug where Factorio would crash during prototyping if both this mod and the omni mods were enabled
0.7.10 - Update to 0.17
	Made the mod compatible with the 0.17 versions of Factorio
	Added replication of refined concrete
	Made the mod compatible with the updated versions of its non-Bob currently compatible mods
0.7.11 - Finish Updating to 0.17
	Made the mod compatible with the updated Bob mods (it didn't break but many items cost too little to replicate and were missing prerequisites and some replications of Bob items didn't appear unless certain Bob mods they aren't included in were enabled)
0.7.12 - New Feature and Vital Bug Fix
	Made the tiers of replicators unlocked via regular research and made their components unlocked alongside them (this one wasn't requested by anyone but it's needed for the below feature and also something I should have done long ago)
	Made it possible for the user to gate a tier of replicators behind space science packs via the mod config
	Fixed a bug where sometimes a replication will be impossible to research due to having one or more hidden technologies as prerequisites
0.7.13 - User Requests
	Made the changelog more readable when viewed on the Factorio mod page's new changelog viewer
	Removed the no-longer-used replication tier research options from the mod's config
	Rewrote large chunks of the guide on how to add replications to be more useful
	Fixed/added some recipes for when Angel's mods are active
	Created a series of new preview images to replace the ones which contain Factorio's old UI
	Created a new 144x144 thumbnail for the mod because of 0.17's new thumbnail rules
