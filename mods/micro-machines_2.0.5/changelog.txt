Version: 1.0.0
Date: September 25, 2020
  Info:
    - Initial Release of Micro Machines, using code borrowed from my Mini Machines mod.
      Many thanks to Kirazy again for providing the scalable graphics code used in both mods.
      Micro Machines concept based on suggestions by Alexs and salariauchiha.
    - Currently includes micro assembler, furnace, miner, beacon, and radar.
      Micro machines are currently balanced towards being expensive, but powerful.
      By default, they are twice as expensive to craft, with the same stats as the original.
    - This mod was designed as a complementary mod to Mini Machines, but can work without it.
      It has not yet been tested with most other mods for compatibility.
      Tested working in vanilla, bobs, fxp, and fantario. 
      Compatibility with other mods should be possible if requested
